# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields (attributes), and the code is in the form of procedures (methods).

## Key Concepts

1. **Classes and Objects**
    - Class: A blueprint for creating objects
    - Object: An instance of a class

2. **Four Pillars of OOP**
    - Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data
    - Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing ones
    - Polymorphism: Ability to present the same interface for different types
    - Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details

## Benefits
- Reusability through inheritance
- Modularity and maintainable code
- Better organization of code
- Secure data through encapsulation
